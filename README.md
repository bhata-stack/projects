# Personal Projects

## 2D Ising Model
### Jupyter

Simulates ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?n^2) particles and how the magnetism changes with temperature using a Metropolis algorithm. Also includes discussion on the Curie temperature that arises from the simulation.

## Double Pendulum
### Jupyter

Simulates the chaotic motion of a double pendulum with/without friction, and generates a gif of the motion.

## N Body Simulation
### Jupyter

(Currently in progress) A simulation of N planetary bodies and their interactions with one another.
